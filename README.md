# minor fork of vim-gnupgp

James McCoy's GNU pgp plugin
https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg

With my usability enhancements.

* documentation
* hide GPG* commands unless needed. The ":GXXX" commands in my workflow are all
  tpope/fugitive commands.

The original plugin seems quite solid, but it looks to be in heavy maintenance
mode, with old "all in one file" style packaging (I'd expect pre path manager
approach). There are 2 pull requests for documentation that are 1-4 years old.

So... to scratch my itch.
